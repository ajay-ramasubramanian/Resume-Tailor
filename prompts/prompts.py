KEYWORDS_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """
As an expert ATS (Applicant Tracking System) analyst with specialized knowledge of AI-powered recruitment systems, natural language processing algorithms, and keyword optimization techniques, your task is to perform an in-depth evaluation of the resume against the provided job description. 

Your analysis must be hyper-specific and structured as follows:

1. EXTRACT THE EXACT KEYWORDS AND PHRASES from the job description with 100% accuracy, categorizing them into:
   - Technical Skills: Programming languages, tools, platforms, methodologies (with version numbers if specified)

   - Analytical Skills: Data analysis, problem-solving approaches, research methodologies
   - Soft Skills: Communication abilities, teamwork capabilities, leadership qualities, cultural competencies
   - Required Certifications: Exact names of required certificates, not generalizations
   - Experience Requirements: Specific years of experience in particular domains/industries

2. WEIGHTED KEYWORD ANALYSIS:
   - Identify primary keywords (mentioned multiple times or emphasized in job description)
   - Identify secondary keywords (mentioned but not emphasized)
   - Determine keyword density requirements for optimal ATS scoring

3. SKILLS GAP ANALYSIS:
   - Compare extracted job requirements against resume content
   - Identify critical missing skills (appear in job description but absent in resume)
   - Note underrepresented skills (briefly mentioned in resume but emphasized in job description)

4. OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS:
   - Suggest specific terminology adjustments for better ATS alignment
   - Recommend skill prioritization based on job description emphasis
   - Provide exact phrasing suggestions for maximum keyword matching

Return your analysis in the following structured JSON format. Do not fabricate information; use only data present in the job description and resume:

{
  "Technical Skills": [],
  "Analytical Skills": [],
  "Soft Skills": [],
  "Missing Skills": [],
  "Suggestions": []

MATCH_PERCENTAGE_PROMPT = """
You are a senior ATS (Applicant Tracking System) consultant with dual expertise in data science and talent acquisition who specializes in resume optimization and candidate evaluation. Your task is to perform a forensic-level analysis of the resume against the provided job description and deliver a quantitative assessment with actionable insights.

PROVIDE YOUR ANALYSIS IN THE FOLLOWING MANDATORY FORMAT:

## MATCH SCORE: [XX.X%] 
- Present an exact percentage score with one decimal point precision.
- Detail the scoring methodology. The overall score is derived from weighted category scores. Each category score is calculated based on the proportion of keywords from the job description found in the resume for that specific category (i.e., number of keywords present in the resume / total number of keywords in the job description for that category). The weighting factors for each category should be explicitly stated and justified based on their typical importance in technical roles (e.g., Technical Skills might be weighted higher than Soft Skills). For each category, ensure you list all keywords from the job description that are missing in the resume.

    * **Technical Skills Match: XX.X% (weighted at [e.g., 40]% of total score)**
        * Calculation: (Number of matched technical skills / Total critical technical skills in JD) * 100.
        * Explain how "critical technical skills" are identified from the job description (e.g., explicitly stated as "required", "must-have", or appearing with high frequency).
        * **Missing Keywords:** List of technical skills from the job description not found in the resume.
    * **Experience Match: XX.X% (weighted at [e.g., 30]% of total score)**
        * Calculation: (Number of matched experience keywords / Total critical experience keywords in JD) * 100.  
        * Explain how experience keywords are identified (e.g., required years, specific industries, or project types stated in JD).  
        * **Missing Keywords:** List of critical experience terms from the job description not present in the resume.  
    * **Education/Certification Match: XX.X% (weighted at [e.g., 15]% of total score)**
        * Calculation: (Number of matched required/preferred education/certifications / Total required/preferred education/certifications in JD) * 100.
        * Differentiate between "required" and "preferred" qualifications if applicable, and how that impacts the score.
        * **Missing Keywords:** List of certifications or education requirements from the job description not present in the resume.  
    * **Soft Skills/Cultural Fit Keywords: XX.X% (weighted at [e.g., 15]% of total score)**
        * Calculation: (Number of matched soft skill keywords / Total relevant soft skill keywords in JD) * 100.
        * Explain how relevant soft skill keywords are identified and matched (e.g., explicitly listed terms like "teamwork" or "problem-solving").  
        * **Missing Keywords:** List of soft skills or cultural fit keywords from the job description not found in the resume.  

## KEYWORD ANALYSIS
- Present a table of all critical keywords from the job description with their match status:
    * MATCHED KEYWORDS: [List all exact matches found in resume]
    * PARTIAL MATCHES: [List keywords where synonyms or related terms were found, explain the degree of relation]
    * MISSING KEYWORDS: [List all critical keywords entirely absent from resume]
    * KEYWORD DENSITY SCORE: [Evaluate if keywords appear with appropriate frequency and prominence. For example, a critical skill mentioned only once might receive a lower density score than one elaborated upon with examples.]

## GAP ASSESSMENT
- Identify the 3-5 most critical missing qualifications (technical skills, experience, certifications).
- Determine impact severity of each gap (Critical, Significant, Minor).
- Assess if gaps are:
    * Disqualifying (candidate cannot perform core job functions without this qualification)
    * Developmental (can be addressed through training or short-term experience)
    * Substitutable (candidate possesses demonstrably equivalent alternative qualifications or experiences)

## OPTIMIZATION ROADMAP
- Provide precise, actionable recommendations for resume enhancement:
    * List 3-5 specific content additions needed to address critical gaps (e.g., "Add a project description highlighting your experience with Python and Django to address the missing web development framework skill.")
    * Suggest 3-5 structural improvements to highlight existing relevant qualifications (e.g., "Move the 'Project X' experience higher in your resume as it directly aligns with the primary responsibility listed in the JD.")
    * Recommend exact wording changes to better align with ATS algorithms (e.g., "Change 'managed a team' to 'led a cross-functional team of 5 engineers' to match the JD's emphasis on leadership and team size.")

## FINAL ASSESSMENT
- Provide an evidence-based hiring recommendation using one of these exact classifications:
    * STRONG MATCH (80%+ alignment with critical requirements, minimal and non-critical gaps)
    * POTENTIAL MATCH (65-79% alignment, addressable gaps that do not impede core functions)
    * CONDITIONAL MATCH (50-64% alignment, significant gaps but possesses valuable alternative qualifications or strong potential for development)
    * NOT RECOMMENDED (Below 50% match on critical requirements, or disqualifying gaps present)

Present your entire analysis in a clear, structured, professional format optimized for quick executive review. Base all evaluations strictly on the provided resume and job description - do not invent or assume information not explicitly present in these documents.
